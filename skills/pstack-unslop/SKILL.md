# Unslop

Edit text to remove AI patterns.

## Process

1. Scan for the patterns below.
2. Rewrite. Preserve meaning, match the intended tone.
3. Self-audit: "what makes this obviously machine-written?" Fix what remains.

Rule numbers are stable ids other skills cite. A removed rule leaves a gap.

## Content

3. **Superficial -ing phrases.** "highlighting...", "ensuring...", "reflecting...", "showcasing...". Delete or expand with a real source.
5. **Vague attributions.** "Experts believe", "industry reports suggest", "some critics argue". Name the source or delete.

## Language

7. **AI vocabulary.** Additionally, crucial, delve, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, interplay, intricate, landscape (abstract), pivotal, showcase, tapestry (abstract), testament, underscore, vibrant. Replace with plain words.
8. **Fancy ways to say "is".** "serves as", "stands as", "boasts", "features". Say "is" or "has".
9. **"Not just X, but Y."** State the point directly.
10. **Rule of three.** Do not force ideas into groups of three. Use the natural number.
11. **Synonym cycling.** Protagonist, main character, central figure, hero, all in one paragraph. Pick one and repeat it.
12. **False ranges.** "from X to Y" where X and Y are not on a meaningful scale. List the items.

## Style

13. **Em dash overuse.** Avoid em dashes entirely. Use periods or commas. No parentheses standing in for dashes, no en dashes, no hyphen-as-dash. If a thought needs separation, end the sentence or use a comma.
14. **Colon overuse.** A colon is fine before a list or an example. Not as a mid-sentence connector. "If you're coming from traditional automation: instead of registering handlers, you describe conditions" adds nothing. Write the point so it stands alone.
15. **Boldface overuse.** Do not bold every proper noun or acronym.
16. **Inline-header lists.** The tell is a bold label and colon that restates the line: "**Performance:** performance improved". Convert to prose. A bold lead-in that ends in a period, names the item, and is followed by genuinely new detail is fine.
17. **Title case headings.** Use sentence case.
18. **Decorative emojis.** Remove from headings and bullets.
19. **Curly quotes.** Replace with straight quotes.

## Communication artifacts

20. **Chatbot phrases.** "I hope this helps", "Let me know if", "Of course", "Certainly", "Found the smoking gun". Remove.
22. **Sycophantic tone.** "Great question, you're absolutely right." Respond directly.

## Filler

23. **Filler phrases.** "In order to" becomes "to". "Due to the fact that" becomes "because". "It is important to note that" gets deleted.
24. **Excessive hedging.** "could potentially possibly be argued that it might" becomes "may".
25. **Generic conclusions.** "The future looks bright." State specific plans or facts.

## Jargon

26. **Abstract metaphor nouns.** Substrate, wedge, vector, locus, vantage, nexus, primitive as a noun, harness as a metaphor, surface meaning "API surface", bedrock, scaffolding as a metaphor, modality, paradigm, gold-plating, ratchet as a metaphor, evacuate for moving code, endgame, north star, flywheel. These read as technical but usually have a plainer concrete word. "Substrate" becomes "base". "Wedge in" becomes "add". "Gold-plating" becomes "more than the job needs". "Ratchet" becomes the mechanism's real name. Pick the concrete word.

## Plain speech

27. **Say what it does, not how it feels.** "The database stays close at hand" names a feeling. So does "SQL you can read". The fix names the mechanism or a number: "`.toSQL()` returns the exact string sent to the database", "a column rename fails the build". Ask what the sentence tells the reader to do or know, then write that. If you cannot restate it as a concrete instruction, fact, or number, cut it. One more check: if the sentence could appear unchanged in another project's docs, it says nothing about this one.
28. **Shorten or split dense sentences.** If the reader has to backtrack to parse a sentence, split it or drop clauses. One idea per sentence.
29. **Active voice.** Catch "is/are/was/were + past participle" and name the actor. "Queries are validated" becomes "the compiler validates queries". Passive is fine only when the actor is unknown or genuinely does not matter.
30. **Cut adverbs, or use a stronger verb.** "Runs quickly" becomes "is fast" or the number. "Significantly improves" becomes the measured delta. An adverb propping up a weak verb means the verb is wrong.
31. **Prefer the plain word.** "utilize" becomes "use", "leverage" becomes "use", "facilitate" becomes "help", "numerous" becomes "many", "in the event that" becomes "if".
32. **Mannered prose.** Metaphor or flourish where a literal phrase exists: aphorisms, rhetorical fragments for effect, personified code, figurative verbs ("rides along", "stands on"), stock framing phrases. "A dial worth turning" becomes "a parameter worth varying". Say what you mean. Rule 26 covers the metaphor nouns.
33. **Over-compression.** Dropped articles, verbless fragments, symbol-speak, and abbreviations that make the reader decode instead of read. "Parser rejects bad date -> exit 2, no write" becomes "The parser rejects a bad date, exits with code 2, and writes nothing." Write whole sentences with their articles and verbs, and spell out arrows and abbreviations.
